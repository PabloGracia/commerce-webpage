# E-commerce-webpage

---

The production version of this app can be found [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/pgracia-ecommerce-portfolio/resources).

I started this project with the intention of learning more about React and its ecosystem, as well as Typescript. To have some guidance with the React bit, I have followed [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) in Udemy to build the app. The course focuses on React on top of Javascript, so in my approach to building the app I have learned from the videos how to build the different bits, and following that I have implemented what I've learn in the course, but using Typescript. To learn how to embed Typescript I have been learning from various resources online.

The technologies/libraries I have used so far for creating the app are (in addition to React):

- **Redux**: Used for containing the data of the app, such as the content of the cart and how all the components interact with it.
- **ReactRouter**: To create the page navigation experience.
- **Stripe**: To handle the payments of the app. -**Firebase**: To handle the user auth (sign up and log in) process.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
